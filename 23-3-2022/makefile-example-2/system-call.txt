int system(fork, execl, wait) //this is a system call


error case for above system call: if child is not created that will be failure

if you dont give any argument to the system() above it will return an error calling too little arguments

in case if we passes the null to system() then it will returns either 0 or 1.
    if returned 1 = shell is available
    if returned 0 = sheel is not available
