in the kernal we have sub systems.

signal sub system is resposible to send signal to each and every process in the user space.

case study(scenario):
when an application has to convey the signal subsystem by giving application to ID and signal number the which we want to deliver to6 application 2.
signal subsystem on behalf of application 1 deliver the signal to application 2.

applications can registers with the timing subsystem. time subsystem is one which collects all CPU time slices. whenever an event occur will then notify to signal subsystem.

application X using an alarm function is registing the timing subsystem for the delivery of a sig alaram signal. 

when time expires will then notify the signal subsystem and signal subsystem will deliver signal to application X


alarm();
