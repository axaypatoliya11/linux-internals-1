policy classified into three things:
1)default 
2)FIFO
3)round roubiry

default linux scheduling policy: will have dynamic priority and change by the system and changed on thread behaviour
FIFO: have some fix priority, 1 is lowest and 99 is highest

with priority 1 will executes first compare to priority 99

FIFO threads untill they execute an terminate or a suspended will not allow othres to schedule and execute

round roubiry: all the threads are in circular linkedlist(circular rode). all threads executes for equal amount of time without having priority
