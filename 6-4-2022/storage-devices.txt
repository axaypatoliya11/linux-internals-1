GRUB(bootloader for linux) - Grand Unified Bootloader

bootloader not only searches for the OS image but it also initializes the external RAM

In bias execution and bootloader execution mode CPU is in Real mode(looking at memory as series of bytes/array of bytes/sequence of bytes). addresses of these provided by vendor of the mother board.

GRUB selects the kernal image and load kernel into RAM and giving the complete control to the RAM and there by GRUB stops


kernal image starts execution in bootstrap code. and bootstrap code will shift the CPU to the protected mode.(this is called as processor initialization)

VM Linux starts execution and is pre-written to start a function called start_kernel().

start_kernel() initializes lots of kernel data structures. while it's initializes memory data structures, interrupt data structures, initializes process table, initializes file related structures and schedules schedular and also initializes kernel threads.


gcov - gcov is GCC's program coverage tool.
it works with respect to GCC to analyse the source code.
also provides computation time for source code.

gcov is used as a profiling tool which helps us to navigate or browse through entire source code. also allows us to modify or change the source code.

to run the command: $gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage file_name.c
this will generate the executable ./a.out as well as file with extension file_name.gcda
then run the command: $gcov file_name.c
it will generate the file called file_name.c.gcov(perform gedit on this file)
$gcov -a file_name.c
$gcov -b file_name.c
