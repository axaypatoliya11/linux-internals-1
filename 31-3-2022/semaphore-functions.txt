semop(); system call is used to change the value of simpahore lock.

int semop(int sem_id, struct sembuf * struct, size_t nsops);

int semget(key_t key, int semg, int semfig);

int semctl(int sem_id, int semnum, int cmd, union semunion);


semaphore number for which we want to change the value. semop() will tell us by which value simaphore will be changed.

flag var is sem_undo. sem_undo helps OS to track/trace down changes done by a process on a simaphore. sem_undo value will help to automatically release a simaphore if process terminated without release.
