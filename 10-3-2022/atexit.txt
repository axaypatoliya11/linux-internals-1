by using atexit((void)(*function pointer)(void)) 

we can register 32 functions using atexit

we can implement default routines. they are not executed immidietly after they called

normal process termination - return(0) OR exit(0)

int atexit()

order of execution of the functions are reverse of their registration(the function register first, execute last and vice versa)

after normal process termination exit() routine is making rhe function calls that are previously registered for a process by atexit() function
