wait();
waitpid(int pid, int*, int option); header file to include: #include<sys/wait.h>

wait and waitpid system calls are forcing the parent process to wait untill child process proceed and execute

3 behaviours of wait:
1) blocks the parent if childs are still executing
2) if a child terminated it will immidietly returns the termination status of the child process
3) when no child executing returns the error

nice value - this is used to change the priority of a process
