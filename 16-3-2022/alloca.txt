void * alloca(size_t nbytes);

when heap section is full and dynamic memory allocation required, alloca system call will allocate memory from stack segment of the process

reputative alloc calls causes stackoverflow

when a memory allocated using malloc, they provide memory from a pool of fixed sizes; resulting a memory fragmentation(left over part which is not being used)

when a memory is allocated using alloac, no fragmentation will be there. it can generate memory of any sizes. very little wastage and fast execution. they do not maintain any .

in malloc if free() is not called, may leads to memory leak and application crash.

in alloac there's no need to call free() this is what the greatest advantage. the moment closing bracket('}') encounters memory will be automatically free
