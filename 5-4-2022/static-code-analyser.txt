Static code analysis is a process of detecting errors, bugs in the source code not being run

it's called static because the code is stationary, code is not running 

it's done by analysing a set of instructions by using some codding standards provided by automation tool

this kind of analysis is helpful to identify the loop holes and the weaknesses in the source code that might harmful

command to analyse the file:
$splint filename.c

splint is a static code analysing tool is used to identify programming errors and bugs and a suspecious code.

programming errors are identified and showed during compilation time.
scripting languagees don't have compilers identifying errors are chellanging 

splint is also identifies code if it's going against prescribed coding standard


clang -stdlib=libc file_map_example.c
objdump --full-contents --section=.comment a.out
sudo update-alternatives --config cc
