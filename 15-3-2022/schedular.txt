linux OS uses sche called as CFS(complete fair schedular)

each and ecery process in not provided with equal proportions of CPU slice time

proportions of CPU slice time depends on a factor called as nice value.

nice value gives weightage to the process w.r.t. CPU slice

nice value priorities a particular process. it can increase or decrease priority of a process

nice value varies from the -20 to +99. -20 is the highest priority and +90 is the lowest priority

the lowest priority still getting a CPU slice time

$taskset is a command that will assign particular CPU to a core. it's a utility toll that comes by default with linux destribution

$taskset -c 1 ./a.exe & taskset -c 1 ./a.exe //we want to run the ./a.exe on the CPU core 1

"&" -> it's a special background symbol in a linux that forces the following commands to run in the background

when nice value = 0 for all the process, each process will have a time slice that is equal to [(1/n)*CPU slice time]
