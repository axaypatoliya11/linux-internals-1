pthread_once once: pthread_once is a data type and once is a object

phread_lib provides a macro to initialize an object/variable of a pthread_once_t

pthread_once_t once = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT

initial value can be either 0 or 1 based on the system

pthread_once(&once, (function ptr)(void)); -> function ptr provides the address of initialization code
after execution of pthread_once verify the first argument(object of type pthread_once_t) if the variable is set, going to schedule and execute the function provided by the function. 

scheduler function takes no argument and returns 

after the execution of initialization code the value of the variable is changed from it's initial value
