source control/version control: source control helps into track down files and files progress of your project over a period of time.

Also allows the user to distribute changed and modified files or a timeline.

Helps against the data damage(code damage/loss/courrepted).

In case of data damage you can go back in time and you can get the snapshots of the projects.

File in GitHub are stored as a series of the snapshots.

Helps in designing complex projects.



In simple terms Git and GitHub is same as Google Drive but the difference is that in GitHub we can store only source files.


Commit is to add/store to local repository.
Push is to add from local repository to remote repository.

Git and GitHub works on a disconnected repository system that is the advantage when connected to other source control. 

:Git project:
working directory->Staged->repository

::3 types of file in working directory:
1) Modified file
2) Staged file(ready to go to next step)
3) Files that are safely stored in repository


:::Basic workflow of GIT:
-modified files will be a part of your working directory
-all the staged files will be under a stage called staging
-once trigerred commit all the files are stored permenently in repository

Git Configuration:
$git config -> command to set the GIT configurations.
->it's a GIT source control tool helps us to get or set fit configuration variable.

$git config --global user.name "   "
$git config --global user.email "   "
--global will gets the information and stores in local machine in root home folder.


clone: it get a copy of the remote repository on a local machine. 


steps to follow:
1)start cloning the remote repository
2)create a working directory to start a project
3)enter to that working directory
